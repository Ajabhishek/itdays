In Doom, players assume the role of a space marine, popularly known as "Doomguy", who must fight his way through the hordes of invading demons from Hell. The game is divided into three nine-level episodes. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring the fourth episode, came out in 1995. <a class="readmore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Read more..</a></span>
